Android app that plays youtube videos in background
Have you ever wanted to play songs or videos in background while you are browsing or reading emails?
I have created an app that let you play youtube videos in background

# App link(app size is of about 3 mb only)👇🏼
https://github.com/92ganesh/YTbackground/releases/download/v1.0.0/YTB.v1.0.0.apk

# How to use (video demo)👇🏼

# Note for Developers only
'google-services.json' which is required for firebase connection is removed from 'app' folder for obvious security reasons. Hence if you want to compile the app yourself then make appropriate changes
