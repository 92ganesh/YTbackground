Android app that plays youtube videos in background
Have you ever wanted to play songs or videos in background while you are browsing or reading emails?
but our sadly youtube does not let you do that without purchasing their premium service
I have created an app that let you play youtube videos in background

# App link(app size is of about 3 mb only)👇🏼
https://github.com/92ganesh/YTbackground/releases/download/1.1.0/YTB.beta.v1.1.0.apk

# How to use (video demo)👇🏼

Note:- 'google-services.json' which is required for firebase connection is removed from 'app' folder for obvious security reasons
